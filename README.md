## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

1. Download JavaFX from https://openjfx.io/
2. ```export PATH_TO_JAVAFX_LIB=<your_javafx_lib_path>```
3. Set the MySql ```url, user and password``` in the `src/library/databaseConnections/MySqlConnection.java` file
3. Run the application using ```sh run.sh```

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
